# Simon-Game
Simon game from 1978 redesigned in JS! - https://shuncio.github.io/Simon-Game/

The rules are simple - once you've started the game, you have to come after flashing boxes via selecting all of them in a chronological order every time when the level growes up.


TODO:
1. Transition from that ugly media queries part of the CSS code into a modern way of styling elements â€“ Flexbox.
